I hope to work with a fairly small company after graduation for a number of reasons:
    1. Scope of work is likely to be wider. I enjoy more responsibility and the challenge of having to be resorceful to find answers. 
    2. Because work is likely to be less specialized, I will be exposed to a wider range of projects than I would be at a large company where work is highly specialized. I think that as a very junior developer, it will be good for me to be exposed to several disciplines. 
    3. Opportunity for equity - opportunities for wealth creation at small companies. Sometimes they go bust, but if that happens, I figure I can find another job.
    4. Generous PTO policies are very important to me, as are opportunites to occasionally work remotely.
